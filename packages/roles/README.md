### Authorization

This package lets you attach permissions to a user which you can then check against later when deciding whether to grant access to Meteor methods or publish data.  The core concept is very simple, essentially you are attaching strings to a user object and then checking for the existance of those strings later. In some sense, it is very similar to tags on blog posts. This package provides helper methods to make the process of adding, removing, and verifying those permissions easier.


    Now with per-group support!

    v1.1.0 - adds support for per-group assignment of roles/permissions

    v1.2.0 - adds the special Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP, used to provide blanket permissions across all groups

<br />

### What's in a name...

Although the name of this package is 'roles', you can define your permissions however you like.  You can have traditional roles like, "admin" or "webmaster".  But you can also assign more granular permissions such as, "view-secrets" or "manage-users".  Often times this is actually better because you are able to handle all those pesky edge cases that come up in real life usage without creating a ton of higher-level 'roles'.  To the roles package, its all strings.

<br />

### Example Apps

The ```examples``` directory contains Meteor apps which show off the following features:
* Server-side publishing with authorization to secure sensitive data
* Client-side navigation with link visibility based on user permissions
* 'Sign-in required' app with up-front login page using ```accounts-ui```
* Client-side routing

The only difference between the two example apps is the routing packages used: one uses ```meteor-router``` and the other uses ```meteor-mini-pages```.

View the ```meteor-router``` example app online @  <a href="http://roles.meteor.com/" target="_blank">http://roles.meteor.com/</a>
  
Run locally:
  1. install [Meteorite][1]
  2. ```git clone https://github.com/alanning/meteor-roles.git```
  3. either
    * ```cd meteor-roles/examples/router``` or
    * ```cd meteor-roles/examples/mini-pages```
  4. ```meteor```
  5. point browser to ```http://localhost:3000```

### Changes to default Meteor behavior

  1. User entries in the `Meteor.users` collection gain a new field named `roles` corresponding to the user's roles. †
  2. A new collection `Meteor.roles` contains a global list of defined role names. ††
  3. The currently logged-in user's `roles` field is automatically published to the client.

<br />

† The type of the `roles` field depends on whether groups are used or not:
```js
Roles.addUsersToRoles(bobsUserId, ['manage-team','schedule-game'])
// internal representation - no groups 
// user.roles = ['manage-team','schedule-game']

Roles.addUsersToRoles(joesUserId, ['manage-team','schedule-game'], 'manchester-united.com')
Roles.addUsersToRoles(joesUserId, ['player','goalie'], 'real-madrid.com')
// internal representation - groups
// NOTE: MongoDB uses periods to represent hierarchy so periods in group names
//   are converted to underscores
//
// user.roles = { 
//   'manchester-united_com': ['manage-team','schedule-game'],
//   'real-madrid_com': ['player','goalie']
// }
```

†† `Meteor.roles` is not published by default.  Here's how you would publish it to every client without needing a subscription:

```js
// in server/publish.js
Meteor.publish(null, function (){ 
  return Meteor.roles.find({})
})
```

<br />

### Usage

1. Add one of the built-in accounts packages so the Meteor.users collection exists.  From a command prompt:
```bash
meteor add accounts-password
```

2. Install [Meteorite][1]
  
3. Add this smart package to your project.  From a command prompt:
```bash
mrt add roles
```

4. Run your application:
```bash
meteor
```

Here are some potential use cases:

<br />

-- **Server** --


Add users to roles:
```js
  var users = [
      {name:"Normal User",email:"normal@example.com",roles:[]},
      {name:"View-Secrets User",email:"view@example.com",roles:['view-secrets']},
      {name:"Manage-Users User",email:"manage@example.com",roles:['manage-users']},
      {name:"Admin User",email:"admin@example.com",roles:['admin']}
    ];

  _.each(users, function (user) {
    var id;
    
    id = Accounts.createUser({
      email: user.email,
      password: "apple1",
      profile: { name: user.name }
    });

    if (user.roles.length > 0) {
      Roles.addUsersToRoles(id, user.roles);
    }
  
  });
```

<br />

Check user roles before publishing sensitive data:
```js
// server/publish.js

// Give authorized users access to sensitive data by group
Meteor.publish('secrets', function (group) {
  if (Roles.userIsInRole(this.userId, ['view-secrets','admin'], group)) {
    
    return Meteor.secrets.find({group: group});
    
  } else {
    
    // user not authorized. do not publish secrets
    this.stop();
    return;
  
  }
});
```

<br />

Prevent non-authorized users from creating new users:
```js
  Accounts.validateNewUser(function (user) {
    var loggedInUser = Meteor.user();

    if (Roles.userIsInRole(loggedInUser, ['admin','manage-users'])) {
      return true;
    }

    throw new Meteor.Error(403, "Not authorized to create new users");
  });
```

<br />

Prevent access to certain functionality, such as deleting a user:
```js
// server/userMethods.js

Meteor.methods({
  /**
   * delete a user from a specific group
   * 
   * @method deleteUser
   * @param {String} targetUserId _id of user to delete
   * @param {String} group Company to update permissions for
   */
  deleteUser: function (targetUserId, group) {
    var loggedInUser = Meteor.user()

    if (!loggedInUser ||
        !Roles.userIsInRole(loggedInUser, 
                            ['manage-users','support-staff'], group)) {
      throw new Meteor.Error(403, "Access denied")
    }

    // remove permissions for target group
    Roles.setUserRoles(targetUserId, [], group)

    // do other actions required when a user is removed...
  }
})
```

<br />

Manage a user's permissions:
```js
// server/userMethods.js

Meteor.methods({
  /**
   * update a user's permissions
   *
   * @param {Object} targetUserId Id of user to update
   * @param {Array} roles User's new permissions
   * @param {String} group Company to update permissions for
   */
  updateRoles: function (targetUserId, roles, group) {
    var loggedInUser = Meteor.user()

    if (!loggedInUser ||
        !Roles.userIsInRole(loggedInUser, 
                            ['manage-users','support-staff'], group)) {
      throw new Meteor.Error(403, "Access denied")
    }

    Roles.setUserRoles(targetUser, roles, group)
  }
})
```

<br />

-- **Client** --

Client javascript has access to all the same Roles functions as the server with the addition of a ```isInRole``` handlebars helper which is automatically registered by the Roles package.

Like all Meteor applications, client-side checks are a convenience, rather than a true security implementation 
since Meteor bundles the same client-side code to all users.  Providing the Roles functions client-side also allows for latency compensation during Meteor method calls.

NOTE: Any sensitive data needs to be controlled server-side to prevent unwanted disclosure. To be clear, Meteor sends all templates, client-side javascript, and published data to the client's browser.  This is by design and is a good thing.  The following example is just sugar to help improve the user experience for normal users.  Those interested in seeing the 'admin_nav' template in the example below will still be able to do so by manually reading the bundled ```client.js``` file. It won't be pretty but it is possible. But this is not a problem as long as the actual data is restricted server-side.

```handlebars
<!-- client/myApp.html -->

<template name="header">
  ... regular header stuff
  {{#if isInRole 'admin'}}
    {{> admin_nav}}  
  {{/if}}
</template>
```

The same with group:
```handlebars
<!-- client/myApp.html -->

<template name="header">
  ... regular header stuff
  {{#if isInRole 'admin' 'researchAndDevelopment'}}
    {{> admin_rad_nav}}  
  {{/if}}
</template>
```

### Tests


To run tests: 
  1. ```cd meteor-roles```
  2. ```meteor test-packages ./roles```
  3. point browser at http://localhost:3000/

_NOTE_: If you see an error message regarding **"The package named roles does not exist"** that means you are either:
  a) in the wrong directory or 
  b) left off the './' in front of 'roles' in step 2.  
  
Step 2 needs to be run in the main 'meteor-roles' directory and the './' is needed because otherwise Meteor only looks in directories named 'packages'.
