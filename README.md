==========

Tapmate is an Instagram (TM) guessing game. How well do you know your friends? You find out by guessing their reaction to fashions, memes, cats or whatever else you "like" on Instagram.

It's not enough to just like things we say.  Love it or hate,  whisper or scream? Love is up, loud is right, right? Perhaps, well in our app it is. You'll see. The rooster is to the up-right. Tapping roster shows face loud and lovely proud. Eagles are proud too, but silent and sneaky. Rats are sneaky too. Seagulls are not sneaky but loud and annoying.

So how does it work? There's a 10 second walkthrough to get you started. Each round starts by showing your own position with a tap on the big image. You then see what others thought as their faces drop in. Last guess your friends opinions by tapping their faces down to the big image. Tap away! Tapping a friend's face into to the picture is a guess, a recommendation and also sends it to their feed. You get points if your guess is close to their tap.

Thanks for soldiering the bugs with us! There's a lot more fun stuff coming in the Tapmatrix. Join us on https://trello.com/b/DvVKmoIi/youiest-tapmate and have a say in what comes next.
