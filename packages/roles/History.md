## v1.2.2

* Support passing user object in addition to _id for Roles.getRolesForUser


## v1.2.1

* Improve internal string value of Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP constant


## v1.2.0

* Use constant property Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP instead of hard-coded string to 
  assign blanket roles/permissions for a user
* Check Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP even if no group specified.  This does not affect 
  normal usage but provides a convenient short-hand for group users:
    Roles.addUsersToRoles(user, 'admin', Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP)
    Roles.userIsInRole(user, 'admin') => true
* Expand test coverage
