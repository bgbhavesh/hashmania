# Meteor Marked
A wrapper of [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) - 
A markdown parser and compiler. Built for speed.

## Usage
It provide a template helper `markdown` as same as official http://docs.meteor.com/#showdown, and a `window.marked` as same as official https://github.com/chjj/marked.
> This package lets you use Markdown in your templates. It's easy: just put your markdown inside {{#markdown}} ... {{/markdown}} tags. You can still use all of the usual Meteor template features inside a Markdown block, such #each, and you still get reactivity.
